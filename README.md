# Neural Proof of Work

hashcash and similar proof of work algorithms rely on finding a hash with a certain number of zeros using a challenge string and a proof string. This is traditionally done with a brute force approach. What if neural networks could be used to rapidly narrow the search space and provide a valid alternative to the guess and check mentality.


1. generate a database with challenge strings and proof strings
2. write a data pipline for training a neural networks (rl / sl)
3. train a neural network
